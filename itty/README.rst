itty.py
=======

The itty-bitty Python web framework.

``itty.py`` is a little experiment, an attempt at a Sinatra_ influenced
micro-framework that does just enough to be useful and nothing more.

Currently supports:

* Routing
* Basic responses
* Content-types
* HTTP Status codes
* URL Parameters
* Basic GET/POST/PUT/DELETE support
* User-definable error handlers
* Redirect support
* File uploads
* Header support
* Static media serving

Beware! If you're looking for a proven, enterprise-ready framework, you're in
the wrong place. But it sure is a lot of fun.

Example
=======

::

  from itty import get, run_itty
  
  @get('/')
  def index(request):
      return 'Hello World!'
  
  run_itty()

See ``examples/`` for more usages.

Thanks go out to Matt Croydon & Christian Metts for putting me up to this late
at night. The joking around has become reality. :)
